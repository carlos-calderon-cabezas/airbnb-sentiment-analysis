Me gustó mucho este lugar. Está a unos 15 minutos de la playa pero la privacidad y ambiente que ofrece vale definitivamente la pena. Disfruté mucho mi estadía!

The hostel is a wonderful quiet retreat in beautiful, vibrant Montanita! I would come back anytime. There is a very well equipped common kitchen and a beautiful chill-out area. Daniel was very nice and helpful.

C’est exactement comme sur les photos. Nous avons passé un séjour formidable ici. Si nous avions pu, nous serions restés plus. Daniel est un hôte incroyable. Il donnerait sa vie pour cet endroit. Tout est impeccable, il nettoie tout plusieurs fois par jour.
Les chambres sont très confortables, propres, même la salle de bain qui est partagée à l’étage pour trois chambres. En tout il y a 6 chambres donc c’est très familial comme ambiance. Une cuisine équipée pour préparer un repas ou un café. Beaucoup de zones de détente à l’étage ou à l’extérieur, hamac, canapés, piscine.
A seulement 10 minutes de la plage et du centre, ce qui fait que l’endroit est extrêmement calme ce qui est impossible dans le centre de Montañita. Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés.

Die Unterkunft ist super! Die Lage ist perfekt, 10 Minuten zum nächsten Supermarkt, 10 Minuten zum Strand, 10 Minuten zu Bars und Discos. Trotzdem ist es bei der Unterkunft ruhig und man kann in Ruhe schlafen. Der Host ist auch sehr nett und hilfsbereit!

I had the best weekend staying in Monica's and Daniel's hostel! It was very comfortable, clean and peaceful and my room was super pretty. Monica and Daniel are super friendly and helpful with everything.
Daniel gave me surfing lessons (my very first surfing experience ever) and I can definitely recommend him.

Meet the perfect hosts here! :) This apartment is part of a very relaxed hostel located at a 10 minute walk from the center. It is perfectly clean and quiet. The hosts are very attentive and help you with just anything. Both are very easy to communicate with, and Monika seems to speak a thousand languages fluently. We only had a few power outages, which are quite common in that area. But most of the time everything worked perfectly and the wifi was very fast. The shared kitchen has all you need for cooking or having your own breakfast, but you should definitely also try Dan's tasty breakfast. You should expect some mosquitoes there. But once we got used to apply repellent in the morning and around sunset, we didn't notice it anymore. Then it is a perfect place to hang out in the hammocks on the cozy terrace. We stayed there for over two weeks, felt very welcome and enjoyed our stay a lot!

Monika goes above and beyond to accommodate her guests. The place is located outside of main area (with bars, food, etc.) which means it is quite peaceful and quiet at night. However it is just a short walk away to any bar, restaurant, and to the beach. Her recommendations for food were wonderful, and the optional breakfasts were great (fruit, toast, eggs, coffee/tea)! We wish we could have stayed longer - she truly makes you feel at home. She is very knowledgeable about the surrounding areas and has great connections! Highly recommend Monika and Danny’s place. Thank you again!

Absolutely great! The best Airbnb hosts! Monika and Daniel were wonderful at answering any questions and very accomodating! Beyond that, our room and the bathroom was extremely clean and comfortable. It was a short walk from town but definitely worth it.

Our stay at Mo’s and Daniels House, the el cielo, was just perfect!
First we didn’t know if we would make it there, due to bus delays, but when we started chatting with Mo, we knew everything would be alright. She organized a cheap taxi for us and Daniel stayed up late until we arrived in the middle of the night + he gave us a cold welcome!
Also the next day, we got many good Tipps from our hosts, which made our stay at montañita just perfect.
The rooms where clean, no Moskitos inside, the internet worth mentioning and the village of montañita + beach in short walking distance.
We enjoyed every minute of our stay and definitely can recommend it for everyone who likes to stay in a house with good vibes and a beautiful family!
Gracias por todo:)
Luke y Caro
Ps:
The coffee was great, too and even tho we didn’t have breakfast, you can have one there. Next time ;)

We stayed in the private king room at Mon and Dan's place for 15 great nights. El Cielo is an easy 8 minute walk to both the town and beach and as a couple we loved having some quiet nights away from the discotheques. Mon and Dan work tirelessly to make the hostel clean and welcoming for their guests and had some great suggestions on where to eat authentic food for a killer price (Casa Tua- 3.50 for three courses). The best part about the hostel is that it really felt like a home away from home. The hostel had some good spots to post up and read a book or play cards and the dogs and cats were adorable and really lovely to be around. Best WIFI for any hostel we've been at and the optional breakfast, beer, and unlimited water was an added bonus. Mon and Dan also helped us gets really cheap fruit and eggs/ham from the passing trucks. All in all, a great start to our trip and would definitely recommend the room for couples staying in Montanita.

Daniel and Monica were lovely. They made us feel at home from the start and were very helpful. Daniels band were playing the first night we got there and everyone from the guesthouse went. The other people staying were also great and we all went for dinner together the next night. However if you wanted to go there and do your own thing that was ok as well. The location was excellent and the room and bathrooms clean. We would recommend Dani and Monica to everyone
